Mediterannean Cuisine, Jackson Tennessee

This website was made for Mediterannean Cuisine in Jackson, Tennessee. One of the many local Ethnic resturants in the city, Mediterranean Cuisine features a wide variety of dishes from Greek and Middle Eastern culture. 

This website had a rough start, as neither team member had any experience in coding. As time moved on, we both picked up better and better understanding of how to make a website. With the guidance of Coach Buccholtz, we were quickly making progress.

However, as soon as major progress began being made, one of the team members was out of school sick for two weeks. This was a major roadblock, and progress grinded to a hault. However, we pushed through, and still managed to have a website submitted for the deadline. 

This process was a very enjoyable experience, as the entire time both team members were adequately learning and experiencing new things.

This website features:

-A menu of Mediterranean Cuisine, as well as prices and contents of each item. 
-A gallery of photographs from the resturant, mostly featuring food from the business. 
-A homepage featuring the address and hours of Mediterranean Cuisine. 
-A location page showing exactly where the business is in Jackson. 
-A contact page featuring the contact information and social medias of Mediterranean Cuisine.
