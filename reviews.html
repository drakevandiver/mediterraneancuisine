          <p>The chicken shawarma is fantastic and the lady that runs the place is very friendly. There is also a juice bar.</p>
          <h6>Lydia P. - 5 Stars </h6>
          <p>Delicious legit Mediterranean food. We are from a heavy Greek / middle eastern area and this was right up there with the best. Great seasoning and very tender.</p>
          <h6>Robin P. - 5 Stars </h6>
          <p>We ordered a cheese pizza, chicken shawarma sandwich, gyro sandwich, and gyro platter with tabouli. It was all delicious and large portions. So much flavor in the chicken sandwich. </p>
          <h6>Eliot H. - 5 Stars </h6>
          <p>The beef and chicken shawarma plates are also great. It is worth getting off the highway if you are passing through and you are hungry.</p>
          <h6>Todd K. - 4 Stars </h6>
          <p>We had chicken shawarma and beef shawarma platters. Both were tasty. Our party disagreed about whether the chicken was dry (I liked it and thought it was good) and we agreed the beef was good. </p>
          <h6>Bill O. - 5 Stars </h6>
          <p>I highly recommend the Gyro Salad and if your appetite is like mine the Beef plate will complement it well!</p>
          <h6>Dennis I. - 5 Stars </h6>
          <p>I had the gyro salad for $8.99 and had to take half of it home because it was so large. The home-made fried pita chips were delicious, meat very flavorful and veggies all fresh.</p>
          <h6>Mixie A. - 5 Stars </h6>
          <p>The Kofta is juicy and flavorful, schwarma is good, but kofta and a Greek gyro salad are probably my favourites. The tabouli is the best I've ever had and the hummus is very good. </p>
          <h6>Sarah C. - 5 Stars </h6>
          <p>We had Gyro Salad & Gyro Plate with a side is Tabouli. Large portions and excellent wait staff!</p>
